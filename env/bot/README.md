## Information
- The source for user_info.py and server_info.py were copied from https://github.com/Carberra/updated-discord.py-tutorial (I'm tired and sometimes it's ok to copy a bit of code)

## Tech

Vulcan Bot uses a number of open libraries to work properly:

- [Discord.py] - 
- [Discord-Py-Slash-Commands] - 
- [Logging] -
